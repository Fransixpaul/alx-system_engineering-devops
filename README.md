Postmortem: The Day Nginx Took a Nap on 2024-08-10
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start: 2024-08-10 14:00 UTC
End: 2024-08-10 15:45 UTC
Impact:
For an hour and 45 minutes, about 75% of our users were greeted with the dreaded 502 Bad Gateway error instead of our lovely web app. It was like showing up to a party, only to find the door locked and the lights off. Europe and North America were particularly hit—sorry, folks! Users experienced slow load times, server errors, and a lot of frustration.
Root Cause:
Nginx got a little overenthusiastic and opened too many connections, leading to an overwhelmed backend API server. Imagine trying to juggle 10 balls when you’re used to just 3—eventually, they all come crashing down.

Timeline
14:00 UTC: Our trusty monitoring system pinged us with an alert. “502 Bad Gateway” errors were popping up like whack-a-moles.
14:05 UTC: The on-call engineer groggily (it’s always coffee time somewhere) jumped in, thinking it was just another network hiccup.
14:10 UTC: Network checked out fine, but the errors kept coming. Application logs? Quiet as a mouse.
14:20 UTC: Called in the big guns—the infrastructure team. Maybe we were under attack by cyber ninjas? The sudden spike in connections sure made it seem that way.
14:30 UTC: After some sleuthing, the team realized Nginx was opening connections like it was handing out candy on Halloween, overwhelming our backend server.
14:40 UTC: Bingo! A recent Nginx update had knocked out a crucial setting, allowing it to go into overdrive.
14:45 UTC: Rolled back the config, restarted Nginx, and watched the errors disappear like magic.
15:00 UTC: All systems go. No more 502s. Phew!
15:45 UTC: Everything went back to normal, and the incident was declared resolved. Time for a victory coffee.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
Nginx, in a fit of enthusiasm (or maybe just misconfiguration), decided to handle more connections than our backend server could manage. When the max limit on open file descriptors was accidentally removed during a configuration update, Nginx went wild, opening connections left and right until the backend server couldn’t keep up and decided to take a nap.
Resolution:
We rolled back the Nginx configuration to its previous, well-behaved state. With the limits back in place, we restarted Nginx, and everything went back to smooth sailing. The backend server woke up refreshed and ready to work.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Nginx, Meet Configuration Management: No more rogue updates. All config changes will now go through a peer review process. Nginx, you’ve lost your unsupervised privileges.
Monitoring on Steroids: We’re adding extra eyes on open connections and resource usage. No more sneaky config changes.
Incident Response Bootcamp: Time for some drills—because next time, we want to catch the problem before it catches us.
Tasks:
Nginx Patch Time: Reapply those max connection limits, and don’t forget to double-check them.
Audit Config Changes: Implement an automated audit system that screams (well, alerts) if anything fishy happens in the configs.
Boost Monitoring: Add detailed tracking of open file descriptors and connection limits to our monitoring system.
Playbook Upgrade: Update the incident response guide to include a step-by-step for quickly identifying server misconfigurations.
Team Training: Get everyone up to speed with incident handling, because the best time to practice is before disaster strikes.
